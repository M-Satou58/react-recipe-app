    content: 'This recipe is the answer to your simultaneous cravings for the ever so savory sisig, and the rich paella. As I said earlier, this is basically the combination of two very well-loved dishes.',
    content2: 'Hearty, meaty, and just absolutely irresistible, you can expect a party of flavors in this Sisig Paella. I understand though if there is some worry over the spiciness I mentioned earlier. But this actually will not have too much of a kick because we will not be using every single ingredient often used in sisig. After all, we don’t want too enormous an amount of flavor in the overall recipe.',

    ingredients: [
      "2 pounds skin-on pork belly, cut into 3 equal pieces",
      "6 whole star anise",
      "2 dried bay leaves",
      "2 scallions, 1 cut into 2-inch pieces, 1 sliced",
      "1 head garlic, halved crosswise",
      "One 1-inch piece ginger, sliced into coins about 1/4-inch thin",
      "1 stalk lemongrass, smashed and cut into 2-inch pieces on the bias",
      "1 tablespoon black peppercorns",
      "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",
      "3 ounces chicken livers or 3 tablespoons canned liver pâté",
      "Vegetable oil, for brushing",
      "1/4 cup calamansi juice",
      "3 tablespoons liquid aminos",
      "2 tablespoons soy sauce",
      "1 tablespoon unsalted butter",
      "1 medium Spanish onion, cut into small dice",
      "6 cloves garlic, minced",
      "3 Thai chiles, thinly sliced",
      "Steamed jasmine rice, for serving"
    ],

    directions: [
      "Add the pork belly, star anise, bay leaves, 2-inch pieces of scallion, garlic halves, ginger, lemongrass, peppercorns and 2 tablespoons salt to a large pot. Cover with about 3 quarts of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the pork is tender, about 1 hour. Let cool in the liquid to room temperature. This allows the pork to stay moist and absorb more flavor. Transfer the pork to a cutting board and pat dry.",
      "Set a grill for indirect cooking and heat to medium-high, about 400 degrees F. Place the pork skin-side down over the indirect heat portion of the grill. Close the lid and cook, until some of the fat is rendered and the skin is starting to crisp, about 20 minutes (see Cook’s Note).",
      "Move the pork to the direct heat portion of the grill. Continue to cook until slightly charred and the skin is crisp, moving the pork when flare-ups occur, 15 to 20 minutes.",
      "Skewer the chicken livers if using. Lightly brush with vegetable oil and season with salt and pepper.",
      "Remove the pork from the grill and let cool. Place the livers on the direct heat portion of the grill and cook, turning every 2 to 3 minutes. Cook until firm and well done, about 12 minutes.",
      "Cut the pork into 1/4-inch cubes and set aside. Finely chop the chicken livers and set aside.",
      "Combine the calamansi juice, liquid aminos and soy sauce in a small bowl and set aside.",
      "Preheat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the butter and pork and cook, continuously stirring and scraping any bits that stick to the pan as the pork begins to crisp, about 10 minutes. Be careful of any fat that splatters from the pan. Discard all but about 3 tablespoons from the skillet. Add the chopped livers, onions and minced garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are slightly crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the calamansi mixture and cook until slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the Thai chiles and scallions. Serve over jasmine rice."

    content: 'Cordon bleu is undeniably a delicious dish as it is what with its irresistible cheesiness, and its satisfying crispy texture on the outside.',
    content2: 'When you combine two popular dishes, you do run the risk of having it not work out. This could be due to contrasting flavors, or cooking processes that are far too different from each other. But because of their similarities— from their meatiness to their delightful tender, flavorful interiors, I decided to recreate two beloved classics. And the result? Some lovely Embutido Cordon Bleu!',

    ingredients: [
      "4  chicken breasts skinless and boneless",

      "1/2 pound Gruyere, grated",
      "1/4 cup all-purpose flour",
      "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",
      "1 cup panko bread crumbs",

      "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.",
      "Lay the chicken breast between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. Using the flat side of a meat mallet, gently pound the chicken to 1/4-inch thickness. Remove the top sheet of plastic and lay 2 slices of prosciutto neatly over the top to cover the breast and sprinkle a quarter of the cheese over the prosciutto. Tuck in the sides of the breast and roll up tight like a jellyroll inside the plastic wrap. Squeeze the log gently to seal and twist both ends tight to form a nice log. Repeat with remaining chicken.",
      "Season the flour with salt and pepper. Mix the bread crumbs with thyme, garlic and kosher salt, pepper, and melted butter. The butter will help the crust brown. Beat together the eggs and season so the flour, the eggs and the crumbs are all seasoned.",
      "Remove the plastic wrap. Lightly dust the chicken with flour, dip in the egg mixture and gently coat in the bread crumbs. Lightly coat a baking pan with olive oil and carefully transfer the roulades onto it. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until browned and cooked through.",
